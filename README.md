# üìà Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Portfolio Optimization

This project explores the use of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and deep learning for solving **dynamic portfolio optimization** problems. We combine methods from reinforcement learning, financial econometrics, and partial differential equations (PDEs) to optimize investment strategies under uncertainty.

## üß† Core Idea

We solve the **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)** equation using PINNs to learn the **optimal value function and policy**. Additionally, we use **LSTM** networks to forecast asset returns and integrate them into a real-time **dynamic allocation** strategy. Benchmarking is done against traditional econometric models (**ARIMA**, **GARCH**) and fixed strategies.

## üîç Key Insights

- **PINN solutions** align closely with analytical results from the Merton problem.
- **LSTM-guided strategies** outperform static benchmarks under realistic constraints.
- **FDM** provides high accuracy but lacks flexibility.
- **Traditional models** (ARIMA/GARCH) offer supporting insights but fall short on dynamic performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- Balancing PDE losses in PINNs
- Overfitting in LSTM due to limited financial data
- FDM grid sensitivity and boundary conditions
- Lag in integrating model outputs into portfolio rebalancing

## üöÄ Future Directions

- Add **transaction costs, slippage, and liquidity effects**
- Use **Transformer-based** return predictors
- Combine **GARCH volatility modeling** with PINNs
- Deploy in **robo-advisors** or **automated trading systems**
